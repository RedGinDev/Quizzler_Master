What is a Property List (.plist)?
Section 9, Lecture 87
The Property List or .plist
.plist is short for Property List and it‚Äôs a file that‚Äôs automatically created with every Xcode project. This file stores configuration information for the application at runtime (when the app is running). The information is stored in a format called a key-value pair. Similar to a dictionary, the key is the property name and the value is the configuration.

For example, when we set the status bar as ‚Äúlight‚Äù in the general settings pane, a property is automatically created in the .plist with

key = Status bar style, value : String = UIStatusBarStyleLightContent.


Here's what Apple has to say about Property Lists in their documentation, if you're interested in getting an in-depth understanding, you can check it out here:
